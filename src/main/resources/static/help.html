    Welcome to the Help Page for Simplicity 4x.<br><br>
    Current Version: 0.0.0 (not even at 0.0.1 yet)<br>
    First, Simplicity is very much a work in progress. If you notice an option or a button that is disabled, that feature
    probably hasn't been implemented yet - though hopefully soon. <br><br>
