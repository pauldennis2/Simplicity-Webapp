Welcome to Simplicity 4x Registration. Registration is quick and <del>painful</del> painless. A few notes before you
get started:
<ul>
    <li>!!!WARNING!!!: Passwords are stored in a CLEAR TEXT FORMAT and are NOT AT ALL secure. I highly recommend you
        use a simple password (that you do not use for anything else) for this app until this changes. You can use
        "password" or "pass1234" or something similar, because let's be honest, you don't care if someone "hacks"
        your Simplicity account. You WILL care if someone acquires the password that you use for everything.
    </li>
    <li>
        Simplicity is very much a work-in-progress. The current version is 0.0.0 (not even at all a game yet!).
    </li>
    <li>
        (For now) Your "email" does not have to be your e-mail; it is just a unique identifier for you. You can use any
        email/username not already taken by another user. If your email is not an email, <del>it's a jar</del> I will
        not be able to contact you about bug reports. You decide if that's a feature or a bug!
    </li>
</ul>
<form action="/register" method="post">
    <input class="trans-bg white-text" type="text" placeholder="Email" required> E-mail <br><br>
    <input class="trans-bg white-text" type="text" placeholder="Handle*" required> Handle <br><br>
    <input class="trans-bg white-text" type="password" placeholder="password" required> Password (CLEAR TEXT)<br><br>
    <button type="submit" class="trans-bg white-text">Create Account</button>
</form>
<br>
*Your "Handle" is how other users will see you. You will use your email (which must be unique) for login. Your handle
will be your "display name".
