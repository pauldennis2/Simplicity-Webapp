    Game settings coming soon!

    A note about save savedGames: all save data is stored in the database. During the early stages of development I will
    likely be "resetting" the database as part of the debugging process. This means (sorry!) for the moment, save savedGames
    do not have any promise of longevity. If enough people start playing and actually enjoying the game, that will of
    course change.

    Your current gameId is:
    <h3>{{gameId}}</h3>
    If you remember this number hopefully soon I will figure out how to load that
    game so you can resume it.

    <button class="trans-bg" ng-click="saveGame()"><h3>Save Game</h3></button>
