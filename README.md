#Simplicity Readme
###Paul Dennis
Welcome to the Simplicity Readme. Simplicity was my final project at The Iron Yard, a coding bootcamp. Almost all of the
development took place over the course of three weeks. I am currently in the process of cleaning things up and
implementing some core features such as saving games and multi-player. I learned a lot from this project. When I
started I had very little experience with JavaScript, so I had to learn as I went.

####Game Description
Simplicity is a "4X" style strategy game inspired by Ascendancy, a game I enjoyed a lot as a kid. Players start with one
planet and must expand, colonizing new planets, researching new technologies, and developing a galactic empire. Try it
here: https://simplicity-4x.herokuapp.com/ (Very much a work-in-progress!)

####Credits
* All of the art in the game (the spaceships, the backgrounds, the planets, etc.) is from a wonderful website,
opengameart.org .
* Thanks to The Iron Yard and Dominique Bashizi (my teacher) for support on this project!

####Collaboration
If anyone is interested in collaborating on this project, I'd love to hear from you! I'd be especially eager to hear
from any front-end/iOS/graphic designers. As you can probably tell from looking at the project, front-end design is NOT
my specialty. See my github profile for contact information.
